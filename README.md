## Background

Detection of disease states like sepsis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and heart attack requires low-latency, broadband, asynchronous streaming capabilities. We have prototyped an early warning platform built with a distributed edge architecture, fed by at-home post-operative monitoring (fitbit, smart phone, wifi devices) and automated Clinical care escalation and coordination processes. This platform has the potential to significantly lower network traffic and cost while providing early warning interventions for our nation's Veterans.
